I"q<p>Product design (a.k.a. Product sense) is the most common problem asked during PM interviews. It should not be confused with the UI-UX or system design challenges. Here, product design is a journey where you explore diverse questions and challenges pertaining to product discovery &amp; development. The journey begins with the search for answers to <em>Why, Who, What, Where, When</em> and <em>How</em>. However, all of these need to be investigated in a limited time frame of 30-45 mins during an interview. Product design problems can be either case studies or open ended questions on technology /physical products.</p>
