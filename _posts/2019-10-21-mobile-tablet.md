Differences between mobile and tablet -
Smartphones are most often used for games (39%) then social networking (24%) and utilities (17%) 
whereas tablets are most used for games (67%! Almost twice as much as phones), social networking (10% less than half the equivalent phone usage) and entertainment (9% which is three times as much as a phone user and utilities barely get a look in with just 4% of tablet usage)
