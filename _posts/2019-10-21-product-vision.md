Tools and techniques useful for defining product /Vision
Techniques for creating vision - through SCRUM or Pet projects (google). Tools for vision - prototypes and mock-ups; personas and scenarios; use cases and user stories; sequences and storyboards; vision boxes and reviews; and the Kano Model. Two effective techniques for determining the product’s value-added and selling points are a product’s vision box and a trade journal review. A vision box is a mock-up of the package in which the product might ship.
