Three Core Motivators for Humans: seeking pleasure or avoiding pain, seeking hope and avoiding fear, seeking social acceptance while avoiding social rejection.
Six factors of ease of use - time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routineness
Part of the brain related to pleasure responds in anticipation rather than reward itself- Nucleus accumbens was not activating when the reward (in this case a monetary payout) was received, but rather, in anticipation of it. (similarly neurotransmitter dopamine)
Variable reward types - Rewards of the hunt (more Information), Social validation or Rewards of the tribe, Rewards for the self (0 inbox emails ) -- like Maslows

Humans search for mastery, completion, and competence
Maintain a Sense of Autonomy :- While persuading add “but you are free to accept or refuse” in the end
Search to resolve uncertainty is a powerful tool of engagement (mystery at the climax of an episode)
Demand for novelty - finite variability creates boredom >multiplayer games have infinite variability or storylines
Human behaviour influencing actions -
We Seek to be Consistent with Our Past Behaviors
We Avoid Cognitive Dissonance
We do Reciprocation
