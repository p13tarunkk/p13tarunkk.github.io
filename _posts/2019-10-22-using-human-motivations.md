Behavioural models in humans have been extensively researched in psychology. Let's understand some of them which could be used by Product Managers for building better products. 
Arguably, there have been three core motivators for Humans : A) seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, B) seeking hope and avoiding fear,  C) seeking social acceptance while avoiding social rejection.

Part of the brain that  pleasure responds in anticipation rather than reward itself- Nucleus accumbens was not activating when the reward (in this case a monetary payout) was received, but rather, in anticipation of it. (similarly neurotransmitter dopamine)
Variable reward types - Rewards of the hunt (more Information), Social validation or Rewards of the tribe, Rewards for the self (0 inbox emails ) -- like Maslows

Humans search for mastery, completion, and competence
Maintain a Sense of Autonomy :- While persuading add “but you are free to accept or refuse” in the end
Search to resolve uncertainty is a powerful tool of engagement (mystery at the climax of an episode)
Demand for novelty - finite variability creates boredom >multiplayer games have infinite variability or storylines
Human behaviour influencing actions -
We Seek to be Consistent with Our Past Behaviors
We Avoid Cognitive Dissonance
We do Reciprocation

Six factors of ease of use - time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routineness

Timer creates urgency for checkout/purchase
'Time of the day' matters for customers - Whether judge will give parole or not ? it is not race, age but the time of day that the parole hearing
