---

Ever wondered if the reviews mentioned on Amazon, Flipkart are fake? You are not alone

There’s no information about the reviewer.
The opinions are all-or-nothing in nature.
Several are posted at the same time.
They don’t go into detail about the item concerned.
They feature smaller words (e.g., ‘big’, ‘good’).
They’re very short (e.g., “This is really good.”)
