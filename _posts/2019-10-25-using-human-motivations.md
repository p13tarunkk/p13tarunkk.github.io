Behavioural models in humans have been extensively researched in psychology. The article describes some of them which can be used by Product Managers for building better products. 

*Motivators*

Arguably, there have been three core motivators for Humans and this has not changed much since the stone age. 
A) seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, 
B) seeking hope and avoiding fear,  
C) seeking social acceptance while avoiding social rejection.

First one is the most interesting for Product Managers. The part of the brain that responds to pleasure (or reward) becomes more active during its anticipation rather than reward itself. The principle is used in apps like Google pay where variable reward creates more excitement through unpredictability.
Variable reward types could also be of multiple types - Rewards of the hunt ( e.g. extreme thirst faced by users for more information/content on social media ), Social validationhttp://localhost:4000/using-human-motivations/ / Rewards of the tribe (e.g. recognition received through recommendations, testimonials or likes), Rewards for the self (e.g. personal achievements for some people like keeping inbox clean at 0 unreads).

*Engagement drives*

We as humans also search for mastery, completion, and competence in daily engagements even when they are using Apps and websites. Search to resolve uncertainty (completion) is a very powerful tool of engagement (e.g. people  tend to watch the movies till the end to resolve the mystery at the climax). Customers inherently like to fill empty spaces (useful for user onboarding) which gives them a sense of completion. People also love to master their acts and compete against others (e.g. gamification) to satisfy their internal self. 

*Exploration drives*

Demand for novelty posseses a strong drive to we humans in accordance with other motivators (like social validation). Finite variability creates boredom after sometime. Therefore almost all popular multiplayer games like PUBG today have infinite variance in the form of storylines. Also, we humans are obsessed in self-love so the personal Stories or Photographs always attract.

*Final Acts*

Below factors play a very crucial role in influencing actions as per inherent Human Behaviour -
-We Seek to be Consistent with  Past Behaviors
-We Avoid Cognitive Dissonance
-We do Reciprocation
Morever to solicit any action from us, ease of taking the action is crucial. The ease of action/use can be measured in terms of time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routineness (Hope all of them are self-explainatory). Golden rule in any design/flow is - less is always better. Our inherent "fear of loosing out" is also utilized by companies by creating artificial scarcities and urgencies (e.g. through Timers at checkout/purchase).
