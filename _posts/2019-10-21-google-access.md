Smart (Google) access - Currently google provides online Single sign on. What if it can also enable or restrict physical accesses?
Fingerprint sensor of phone can give access with wifi, bluetooth, NFC and id/pass. Also it can restrict public and paid places (like restaurants, lounges, Movie theaters, museums, tourist places, airports, railway station) for X mins else you will be charged. We may not even need ticket numbers. Just use fingerprint on your phone while booking and while enter scan your fingerprint again. We see so many queues of people booking tickets especially at tourist places. Can be integrated with Google maps and google pay for integrated experience
