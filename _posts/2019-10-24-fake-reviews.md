Ever wondered if the reviews mentioned on Amazon, Flipkart are fake ? You are not alone as product companies too build algorithms to weed them out regularly. Here are 8 key signs to identify fakes and  save yourself some time and money ! 

1. Have very less, fake or even no reviewer information (like nick names, no previous history)

2. Have only opinions that are all-or-nothing in nature

3. Multiple similar ones that are posted at the same time/day

4. Don’t go into detail about the item concerned
 
5. Have extensive use of smaller (and more common) words (e.g., ‘big’, 'bad', ‘good’)

6. Very short reviews (e.g., “This is really good.”)

7. No personal data of the reviewer (no photo)

8. Reviewer reviewing only on a single seller or product with no purchase history
