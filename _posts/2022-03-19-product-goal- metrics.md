Setting goals for product features is a special art in product management. A product is successful only if it achieves its intended objectives or goals. Defining and measuring the product's or its features' success needs good understanding of company goals, business, product vision, strategy, roadmap, its users, end customers and stakeholders. Hence, it is also a standard question in product manager interviews at all levels like Product Execution Interview at Facebook (FB / Meta). <br>
```
Sample Goal Metrics Problems :-

How would you go about setting goals for Instagram hashtags?  
How would you measure success for IG stories?
How would you set goals for Instagram Reels? 
What goals and success metrics would you set for buy & sell groups?
How would you set a goal for Facebook Lite?
What top 3 metrics would you track for Quora
What should uber eats goals be for the next 12 months?
What would be goals and success metrics for video conferencing app (Hangouts, Zoom)?
```

<u>So what does product success look like ? </u>

Product goal describes a long-term objective or future state of the product.
Product metrics are needed to track the success of the product against its goals. These help to identify existing gaps, plan roadmap and prioritize the next set of features and enhancements. These are extensively used during 
* Leadership approvals (business case)
* Product launches (as success criteria)
* Annual, quarterly plannings (as KPIs - Key Performance Indicators or OKRs - Objective Key Results or OSTMs - Objectives Strategy Tatics & Metrics ) & 
* Sprint excercises  (as acceptance criteria) <br>


These need to be <u>SMART </u>- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound for measuring the success accurately

<u>What are the different classifications of metrics ?</u>

Generally to measure success of a products, following 3 types of metrics are used -

* **Business metrics** like reveneue, profit, efficiency
* **User metrics** like usage from various users
* **Platform metrics** like page load time, supply-demand matching ie bookings


Metrics are also classified as  -
* **Northstar metrics** (or Key goal metrics) that identified critical product value - GMV, Sales or Daily Active Users
* **Product Tracking** (or Product health metrics) that support Northstar metrics  and measure deeper product health like number of Users or number of likes, comments and shares
* **Guard-Rail** (or Counter metrics) that are measures of tradeoffs, risks or possible cannibalization of another feature or metric 
e.g. NPS, CSAT

Moreover, leading metrics (leading indicators) are those which look forward and but can represent future outcomes while lagging metrics (lagging indicators) represent current and past state and are not good predictors of near future. <br>
E.g. - When measuring sales, Revenue per user is a leading indicator while churn rate is a lagging indicator. Dropping revenue per user is an urgent sign of sales reduction while high churn rate of customers over a longer period will eventually impact sales

Now, lets discuss how we set goals and metrics to define product's success


<p style="color: #EA2F65"> <b>1) Situation </b></p>

It is important so that you understand the product, company and problem space. Clarify the situation and develop common understanding by asking some relevant questions.

```
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS TO ASK :-

What is the product and the company ?
What is the stage of the product in its lifecycle?  
Should we focus on any geography or think globally ?
What is the competitive landscape ?
Is there a particular company strategy to build new goals ?
What are the key user values and actions ? 
Do we have any particular customer segment or situation like Covid I should focus on?
Is there any specific timeframe for goals ? 
```

Note:- You don't need to ask all of these questions instead you can assume some things and state the same E.g. if the product is Facebook Live, you can mention - "My understanding is that Facebook Live is a matured product and is aimed at driving engagement for global audience"


<p style="color: #EA2F65"> <b>2) Mission</b></p>

Reiterate the mission and vision of the company and/or product. This is helpful to build the right goal strategy, say -
“Before I build an approach, let me touch upon the mission for Facebook ”

```
MISSION  :-
Facebook - Make world more connected and help people build communities
Instagram - Allowing people to capture and share moments of their life
To bring you closer to the people and things you love
Google - Organize the world's information & make it universally accessible & useful
FB Watch - allows users to view videos from friends, groups & thus bring them together
```

<p style="color: #EA2F65"> <b>3) Users</b></p>

Product goals are tightly coupled with the users in almost all modern businesses. Identifying different users and their journey help to build a comprehensive list of user metrics and possible goals. Users can be Supply side - Demand side; Primary users - Secondary users; Internal users - External users; Buying customers or Users using the product

E.g.
Instagram users are
- Content creators
- Influencers or Celebs
- Content consumers
- Advertisers or Brands

User Journey :- 
Discover > Interest > Desire > Reach > Find > Access > Learn > Test > Use > Complete > Validate > Share
<br>
<br>
E.g. User journey of a traveller:- Deciding Destination > Plan Itinerary > Activities > Express and Share memories

```
USERS :-
Artists, Content creators, Advertisers, Young Adults, 
Parents, Kids, Elders, Students, College goers, Religious, 
Working professional, Traveler, Affluent, Price Conscious, 
Risk Averse, Influencer, Follower, Volunteers, Activists, 
Conservatives, Digital Nomad, Hiker-Traveler, Educators
```

Detailed user segmentation is generally not necessary but it is still best to ask if goals should be for any specific segment - Read [segmentation](https://prodbee.com/Users/)				

<p style="color: #EA2F65"> <b>4) Metrics</b></p>
	
Now, that you have better clarity about the mission and the users, let's build and state the approach. <br>
Generally metrics are measured across the entire user funnel - 

* Awareness
* Acquisition
* Adoption
* Engagement
* Retention
* Monetization
* Satisfaction

Atleast 2 - 3 metrics should be identified across the funnel before selecting an overarching North star metric (primary goal metric) and few supporting metrics (Product health metrics) and counter metrics as part of prioritization (next step). 
These should be tracked across all relevant users, supply, demand, business and platform (whatever applicable) - consider 2X2 of these against the funnel metrics.

E.g. 
For Airbnb the key metrics are

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Airbnb_case_product_KPIs_metrics.png" 
		 alt="User_Segmentation"
     width="100%" 
     height="auto" />					

```
METRICS :-

ACQUISITION OR REACH - User Traffic or hits ( direct, organic, referral, promotional )
, Bounce rates

ADOPTION - Install/downloads, Unique Users, Signups, # Sessions/DAC, 
%age of new users

ACTIVATION  - No. of groups, no of groups/users, Bookings/user, 
Avg days for first 3 bookings (measures key event after adoption)

USER GROWTH - channel traffic, new users, repeat users

ENGAGEMENT   
- %age of users using the feature on daily, weekly, monthly basis - DAU, WAU, MAU  
- Activity or User actions - creations-posts, click, session, view, like (passive), 
comment(active), share, subscribe,  session length (in terms of users or session)
, notifications viewed/ctr, card abandonment rates, #messages responded or viewed
- Response rate, response time, TAT 
- Avg reach of content - Number of views per post, Ad views per user

RETENTION - DAU/MAU, cohort - D7, D30, weekly repeat active users

STICKYNESS - DAU per MAU, x actions per month

CHURN - Not active for X days, not renewing

COVERSION - to goals like subscription, checkins, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

MONETISATION -  Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), Revenue, CTR, Avg Revenue/User (ARPU)
Customer Life time value (CLV), Subscriptions/conversions, Revenue per Ad

SATISFACTION - CSAT, SUS, NPS, User ratings, Referrals
```

Note:- Many of the metrics are heavily inter-related e.g. Facebook makes revenue via ads (monetisation), and ad revenue is directly proportional to the engagement and coversion metrics of users like clicks, subscriptions and also their retention on the platform

<p style="color: #EA2F65"> <b>5) Prioritise</b></p>

In previous step, we defined the metrics for each funnel stage that indicate movement towards goal. Now, it is time to build a goal strategy and prioritize the metrics that are more relevant and impactful towards the goal. 
First and foremost, the stage of the product in the lifecycle (new, growing, mature) helps to identify which part of the user experience funnel to focus on (acquisition, engagement, conversion, retention, monetization). 

<u>Goal Strategy</u>

* If the product is new or is being launched, and the primary goal is generally adoption (number of users). Hence, focus on acquisition, conversion, and engagement metrics instead of retention metrics. 
* If the product is in growth stage, the goal is generally to increase engagement (e.g. instagram reels), then focus can be on engagement, and retention funnel stages which are closer to the goal. 
* For matured products like Facebook, generally focus is on engagement, retention of its huge userbase and their motenisation. 

<u>Prioritised metrics</u>

North Star Metric is the primary broad indicator towards the goal. It indicates whether the product is both benefitting the users and impacting the business.
For the interview, it is recommended to specify 1 North star metric, 2-5 supporting metrics that relate best to your identified goals. It is also suggested to provide a couple of counter metrics or gaurd rail metrics to track any counter affects and risks associated with the product or feature. <br>
It is important to use an appropriate timeframe for these metrics, which generally depends on the company’s performance review cadence (generally weekly to Quarterly)

E.g. -
For Instagram Reels feature, the goal is engagement for Instagram which is measured by the primary metric (North Star Metric or NSM) of Daily Active Customers actively engaging with Reels.

* **North Star Metrics** - Daily Active Customers engaged with Reels (with >15 secs view time)
* **Product health metrics** -  # No. of User Egagements on Reels (likes,shares,comments) , #No. of Reels Created, # No. of Customer Views, $ Revenue from ads
* **Counter Metrics** - User Session time or Time spent on Reels vs other areas of IG

 <i>Pro Tips :-
<br>#Keep the prioritized metrics as simple as you can<br>
	 #Metrics change as products evolve - new products have basic metrics close to top line/bottom line of business, mature     products have more detailed/custom metrics like number of engaged users >30 sec watch time<br>
    #Do not use vanity and non-actionable metrics<br>
    #Try to use Absolute metrics than rates to avoid base effect<br>
    #Do not forget the timeframe of measuring the metric (e.g. no. of new signups weekly)<br>
    #Avoid competition benchmarking metrics like market share unless necessary like new business launch<br>
    #You can also measure metrics as Target Vs Actuals like Quarter to date
</i>

<u>Tradeoffs</u>

It is recommended to critique your metrics by discussing any broader risks, forseen fallbacks. You can discuss the counter metrics to highlight cannibalisation, overuse and customer satisfaction issues. <br>
E.g. If the product feature is newly launched it is important to closely track the customer reactions on social media, customer support issues, bugs, resolution time, and various platform performance indicators like downtime, no. of bugs, avg load time etc. <br>
Tracking edge-cases or failure rates like no matches, no results page, inactive users are also key to success of products depending on their maturity and business relevance.

Note:- In interviews, goal setting question is very often followed by another [Product Execution Question](https://prodbee.com/how-to-solve-product-execution-problems-the-great-pm-interview/) like - <br><i> What would you do as PM if this product metric X goes down by Y % ? </i> <br> (see [Solving a Product issue](https://prodbee.com/how-to-solve-product-execution-problems-the-great-pm-interview/))
