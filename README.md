**Create a branch**: 

   `git checkout -b <my-new-feature-or-fix>`

**Make necessary changes and commit those changes**:

   `git add .`

   `git commit -m "new feature or fix"`

**Push changes**, replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier at step #3. :

   `git push origin <add-your-branch-name>`

Submit your changes for review. Go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a **Compare & pull request** button. Click on that button. Now submit the pull request.

That's it! Soon I'll be merging your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged. Thank you for your contribution.
